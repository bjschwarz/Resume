\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am writing you in regard to COMPANY NAME's POSITION. As a developer who is passionate about user centered design and crafting a seemless experience, I found this position to be an excellent match. I have over seven years of experience developing frontend specific as well as full stack solutions. I have worked on applications ranging from C++ QT interfaces for distributed camera systems, to Vuejs progressive web applications, to full stack Blazor Dotnet. 

\lettersection{Why COMPANY NAME?}
My experience at Thetacore included designing and prototyping user interfaces, testing and debugging, building a test suite, and creating graphical visualization for product needs. I learned how to be productive when working on a small remote team. I also learned many best practices when it comes to architecting a distributed SAS Application. I believe that my experience fits well with COMPANY and I would leverage my expertise well.  

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have a broad range of skills. My experience with Human Factors and Cognition gave me an understanding and appreciation for elegant design. I have designed and implemented applications myself as well as worked with designers. Additionally, I have used many application development technologies so I find it easier to learn and adapt to new ones.
